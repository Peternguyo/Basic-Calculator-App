# Basic-Calculator-App
I have created a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

# Basic Calculator App (Python)

This is a simple basic calculator application written in Python. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

* **Clear User Interface:** Prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation.
* **Supports Basic Operations:** Performs addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
* **Error Handling:**
    * Handles `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input for the numbers.
    * Prevents division by zero and displays an appropriate error message.
    * Handles invalid operation input, informing the user to enter a valid operator.
* **Clear Output:** Displays the calculation performed and the resulting answer in a user-friendly format.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2.  **Save the Script:** Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `calculator.py`).

3.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the `calculator.py` file.

4.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

5.  **Follow the Prompts:** The application will then prompt you to enter the first number, the second number, and the operation you want to perform. Enter the values and press Enter after each prompt.

6.  **View the Result:** The calculator will display the result of the operation.
